## General info
Problem -> The energy consumption of the ICT infrastructure has been rising steadily. These high rates of energy consumption translate into large carbon footprints since coal, the most carbon-intensive approach to producing energy, remains the single largest source of power generation globally. The wired-network infrastructure alone is predicted to become a considerable portion of the total ICT energy consumption.

Preliminary Analysis -> A study was performed to compare the operational energy efficiency of network hardware based on their forwarding configurations. The testing results indicated that different device configuration parameters have a significant impact on the energy efficiency of the device.

## Part I: NetPow
Now that a difference is determined in the operational energy efficiencies of network devices, the next problem was to create a real-time, non-intrusive network power monitoring framework. Information models were employed to expose the power information from simulated network agents. More details in the [research paper](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=100508) and the [NetPow GitHub repo](https://github.com/rahil-g/netpow).

## Part II: GPF
Green Power Forwarding is a novel technique to incorporate individual device energy efficiency into network-wide routing decisions. A new routing metric and algorithm were developed to select the lowest-power, least-congested paths between destinations. More details in the [GPF GitHub repo](https://github.com/rahil-g/gpf).
